    Simple task that has a trivial payload: converting integers into ascii characters. The task is
    designed to be a workflow with 26 branches. Each branch creates one character (a-z) and saves
    it to a json output file. While branches are numbered continuously from 0 to n-1, the actual
    data it processes is defined in the *branch_map*. A task can access this data via
    ``self.branch_map[self.branch]``, or via ``self.branch_data`` by convenience.

    In this example CreateChars is a LocalWorkflow, but in general it can also inherit from multiple
    other workflow classes. The code in this task should be completely independent of the actual
    *run location*, and law provides the means to do so.

    When a branch greater or equal to zero is set, e.g. via ``"--branch 1"``, you instantiate a
    single *branch task* rather than the workflow. Branch tasks are always executed locally.
